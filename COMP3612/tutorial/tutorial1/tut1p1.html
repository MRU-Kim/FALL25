            The library in the British Museum in London. The British Museum Reading Room, 
            situated in the centre of the Great Court of the British Museum, used to be the main 
            reading room of the British Library. In 1997, this dunction moved to the new British 
            Library building at St. Pancras, London, but the Reading Room remains in its original 
            form at the British Museum.
